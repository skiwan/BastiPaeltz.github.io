Some of my finished, ongoing or projects planned for the future.
Most of them can be found over at `Github
<http://www.github.com/BastiPaeltz/>`_.

------------

codedict
---------- 
:description: A command-line dictionary written in Python, aimed towards developers.
:status: final
:tools used: Python, Sqlite   
:story:
	This was my first rather "big" project and my first python project as well.
	The motivation was while learning myself some python I realized that I can memoize
	things much better when writing them down. So essentially codedict is a CLI to help 
	you running a dictionary or documentation for things like programming languages or algorithms.

ownsheet
---------- 
:description: Chrome extension for generating pretty cheat sheets from markdown.
:status: final
:tools used: Angular, JQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS    
:story:
	I once stumbled across the webpage `overapi.com <http://www.overapi.com/>`_, where they create cheat sheets for all kinds of software development related things (of varying quality sadly) and generate a nicely looking box layout. I wanted to do the same but with any sheet/style guide or whatever. So ownsheet was born.  

gonitor
---------- 
:description: Simple server monitoring tool written in go.
:status: final
:tools used: Go and a bit of Python, Travis CI
:story:
	Diving into Go I was fascinated about how easy it is to write concurrent software with it. Since it was on my somewhere-in-the-future-to-program list anyway, I started gonitor which monitors a few things on your server like patterns in log messages or checks if a process is still running and simply sends you mail if something goes on. Nothing for enterprise level, but might be a nice solution for small servers.
		
godrossel
------------
:description: web service that I use when I'm on low bandwith.
:status: final
:tools used: Go and a bit of HTML   
:story:
	Sometimes browsing the web with limited network bandwith can get really slow and because of that annoying. Basically godrossel does the google searching for you and minifies(no JS, images etc.) everything that search yields so surfing the web is a bit ess pain in these situations.

tba
---------- 
:description: Interactive programming tutorial platform.
:status: discontinued (for now)
:tools used: Sails(Node.js)   
:story:
	I once had the idea to build a interactive coding platform with the unique feature that the tutorials are composed by users. They include basic explanation parts but also interactive coding where the tutor can write unit tests the program is run against. It is definately doable but requires a lot of work + the sandboxing for the user code is different for every programming language making it even harder. For the webserver-part I looked into Sails.js which is really nice and will definately be on my future-list.

server
---------- 
:description: My server(s) and everything related to them.
:status: (always) ongoing
:tools used: Unix, Bash scripting
:story:
	While not really a standalone project, I always try to get better at administrating my servers and learning the Unix way. I am constantly try to get new services up and running and to host as much as possible on my own. 

wargames
---------- 
:description: A wargames adventure to teach people the Unix tools and philosophy as well as Bash scripting.
:status: planning
:tools used: .
:story:
	A few days ago(October 2015) I discovered Wargames like Bandit on `OverTheWire
	<http://www.overthewire.org/>`_ teaching people Unix tols and Bash scripting. I want to build one as well. Will take a long time ... probably.
